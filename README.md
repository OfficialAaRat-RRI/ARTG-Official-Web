Before Running we kindly request you to read [Contributing.md](https://github.com/OfficialAaRat-RRI/ARTG-Official-Web/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

1. Make sure you have Node.JS installed to the latest version.
2. Fork / Clone the repo in your local device and install all the node modules from `package-json` via `npm install`.
3. Make a `src/config.json` file and add the following -
```json
{
    "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "" ,
    "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "" ,
    "GOOGLE_API_KEY": ""
}
